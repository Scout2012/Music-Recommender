### Music Recommender

## Description

This Music Recommendation System is part of a project for CSUF's CPSC 481 Artificial Intelligence

## Goal

The goal of this project for the scope of the class is to simply take a list of audio files (or youtube links? possibly...)
and suggest you similar songs.

## Inspiration and Motivation

The motivation for this project is from my personal interest in both Music and Artificial Intelligence. It is no secret
that Artifical Intelligence is the way of the future. We can already see systems similar to what this project aims to create
being implemented in services offered by companies similar to Spotify.

I was interested in how these systems were created, and this curiosity lead me to a wonderful publication titled
[_Music Recommendation and Discovery in the Long Tail_ by Òscar Celmai](http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationBook/index.html)

Many of the implementations seen in this project draw inspiration from the methods described in this book.
